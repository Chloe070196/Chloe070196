# Welcome !

## Hello there, I'm Chloe, a junior full-stack developer

 with a passion for **solving real-life problems** using code. I started coding last year and joined Boolean UK, completing their **6-month, full-time, full-stack software development bootcamp**, and I have not stopped since then.

Have a look at my experience and projects on my [**portfolio**](https://chloe-zermatten-portfolio.vercel.app/), or get in touch with me on [**linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloÃ©-z)!

They've all been tons of fun to learn, but I must say that figuring out JavaScript's quirks has definitely been a fun ride! I'm currently honing my skills by working on a booking app (full stack: TypeScript, React, Express, TypeORM, Postgres, Jest), and completing C# challenges (mini-projects).

### Frameworks & libraries

#### Frontend

![SVG Image](./assets/svg/vue-svgrepo-com.svg)

Of the two, I'm definitely more familiar with React - I've spent a lot of time experimenting with it, and it's been great! Learning Vue is a bit of a personal project - I make it a point to spend time playing around with new technologies so I keep my learning skills fresh! Also, I find it very rewarding to figure out how to use a new tool, which is super motivating!

#### Backend

I love the freedom express.js gives since it is unopinionated, but then again, I've learnt so much through my brief stint using NestJS for my graduation project that I'm definitely going to be spending more time with it!
As for prisma, it's been awfully handy. Using this ORM regularly when completing boolean exercises and challenges essentially taught me how to make the best use out of the documentation available, a skill that is super useful.

### Workflow / IDE tools

![SVG Image](./assets/svg/vscode2-svgrepo-com.svg)
![SVG Image](./assets/svg/github-142-svgrepo-com.svg)

Working with these tools daily, I keep discovering new features and settings. VS Code has been absolutely great, especially for resolving conflicts occuring upon merges. I can't wait to see what other cool feature I'm going to stumble upon as I keep experimenting around!
